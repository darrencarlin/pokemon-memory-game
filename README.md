Following this tutorial: https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/

I have expanded on this by adding an array with the original 151 Pokemon which the program selects 12 randomly at the beginning, different difficulty modes, time and guess count, a datebase with leaderboards.


Todo:

  * Add option to view leaderboard without playing
  
  
  Finished 
  
  * Add difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  * Keep scores based on time and number of guesses.
  * Hook it up to a scoreboard with a database using firebase.
  * Add music
  
Bugs: 

To fix:

  * Sometimes cards are coming back undefined on the name property of the JS object
  * Double clicking inverts the game board

Fixed:

  * 3rd click bugs out the game cards preventing you from clicking that card unless another is clicked first.
